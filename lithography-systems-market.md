<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lithography Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Printers</li><li>Proximity Printers</li><li>Projection Printers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lithography systems encompass various printing technologies used in semiconductor manufacturing. Contact printers operate by placing the mask directly against the substrate, allowing precise image transfer but potentially limiting the resolution due to mask defects. Proximity printers maintain a small gap between the mask and substrate, reducing defects while achieving improved resolution, suitable for larger features. Projection printers utilize optics to project the mask image onto the substrate from a distance, allowing for high-resolution patterns and enabling the manufacture of smaller, intricate designs.</p></p>
