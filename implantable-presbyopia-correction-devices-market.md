<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Presbyopia Correction Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Corneal Inlays</li><li>Scleral Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Implantable presbyopia correction devices are designed to address age-related vision loss. The market includes two primary types: corneal inlays and scleral implants. Corneal inlays are small devices placed in the cornea to enhance near vision while maintaining distance vision. They often utilize optical principles to improve focus. Scleral implants, on the other hand, are positioned in the sclera, providing a broader correction for presbyopia by improving the eye's overall refractive properties. Both aim to reduce dependency on glasses.</p></p>
